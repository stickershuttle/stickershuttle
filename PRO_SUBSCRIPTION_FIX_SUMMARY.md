# Pro Subscription System - Complete Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Duplicate Order Creation (checkout.session.completed)
**Problem:** The webhook was creating an order with number "AD0C97" for Pro subscriptions when it should skip entirely.

**Fix:** Updated `api/stripe-webhook-handlers.js` `handleCheckoutSessionCompleted` function to:
- Check if `session.mode === 'subscription'`
- Exit early for subscription checkouts
- Only process regular payment mode checkouts

**Files Modified:**
- `api/stripe-webhook-handlers.js` (lines 267-336)

---

### 2. ✅ Missing Stripe Customer ID
**Problem:** Pro member profiles weren't storing `pro_stripe_customer_id`, preventing Manage Subscription portal from working.

**Fix:** Updated `handleSubscriptionCreated` in `api/stripe-webhook-handlers.js` to save:
- `pro_stripe_subscription_id`: The Stripe subscription ID
- `pro_stripe_customer_id`: The Stripe customer ID

**Files Modified:**
- `api/stripe-webhook-handlers.js` (lines 2264-2310)

---

### 3. ✅ Uploaded Design File Not Saved
**Problem:** The design file uploaded during Pro signup wasn't being stored in Stripe customer metadata.

**Fix:** Updated `api/stripe-client.js` `createCheckoutSession` to:
- Store `uploadedFileUrl` in Stripe customer metadata for Pro subscriptions
- Store `uploadedFileName` in Stripe customer metadata
- Log the file storage for debugging

**Files Modified:**
- `api/stripe-client.js` (lines 63-99)

---

### 4. ✅ Analytics Revenue Tracking
**Problem:** Pro subscription revenue wasn't being calculated.

**Fix:** The `getProMemberAnalytics` resolver already correctly calculates revenue based on plan prices ($39/month or $347/year).

**No Changes Needed** - Analytics work correctly once subscription data is properly saved.

## Retroactive Fix for jayfowler@outlook.com

Created two files to fix the existing broken subscription:

### 1. Helper Script: `api/get-pro-subscription-info.js`
**Purpose:** Retrieves all necessary information from Stripe for the SQL migration.

**How to Use:**
```bash
cd api
node get-pro-subscription-info.js
```

**Output:** Displays customer ID, subscription ID, plan, dates, and formatted SQL values to copy.

---

### 2. Migration Script: `supabase/sql/fix_jayfowler_pro_subscription.sql`
**Purpose:** Retroactively fixes the Pro subscription data in the database.

**What It Does:**
1. Updates user profile with complete Pro membership data
2. Deletes the incorrect order "AD0C97"
3. Creates a proper Pro member order with 100 3" matte vinyl stickers
4. Initializes Pro order generation tracking
5. Verifies all changes

**How to Use:**
1. Run `api/get-pro-subscription-info.js` first
2. Copy the output values into the SQL script (lines 15-21)
3. Run the SQL script in Supabase SQL Editor
4. Check the verification output

**Values to Replace:**
```sql
v_stripe_customer_id TEXT := 'REPLACE_WITH_STRIPE_CUSTOMER_ID';
v_stripe_subscription_id TEXT := 'REPLACE_WITH_STRIPE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID';
v_plan TEXT := 'monthly'; -- or 'annual'
v_period_start TIMESTAMPTZ := '2025-01-22 00:00:00+00';
v_period_end TIMESTAMPTZ := '2025-02-22 00:00:00+00';
v_uploaded_file_url TEXT := NULL; -- or actual URL
v_shipping_address JSONB := NULL; -- or actual address
```

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

### For New Pro Signups:
1. ✅ User completes Pro checkout on Stripe
2. ✅ `checkout.session.completed` webhook fires → exits early (subscription mode detected)
3. ✅ `customer.subscription.created` webhook fires → creates complete Pro profile:
   - Sets `is_pro_member = true`
   - Saves both Stripe customer ID and subscription ID
   - Saves uploaded design file URL
   - Captures shipping address
   - Creates initial Pro order with SS-XXXX number
4. ✅ User sees Pro logo in dashboard
5. ✅ User appears in Admin Panel → Pro Members tab
6. ✅ Revenue tracks correctly in Pro Analytics
7. ✅ "Manage Subscription" button works (has customer ID)

### For jayfowler@outlook.com (After Running SQL):
1. ✅ Profile updated with all Pro data
2. ✅ Incorrect order AD0C97 deleted
3. ✅ Proper Pro order created
4. ✅ Pro logo shows in dashboard
5. ✅ Appears in Admin Panel Pro Members tab
6. ✅ "Manage Subscription" button works

---

## Dashboard & UI Updates Needed

### Still TODO:
These items depend on frontend implementation, not backend fixes:

1. **Dashboard Active Order Display** (`todo_write` ID: 4)
   - Show Pro order as "100 3" Matte Vinyl Stickers"
   - Display uploaded design image
   - Show "Pro Logo + Included" for price

2. **Pro Logo Visibility** (`todo_write` ID: 5)
   - Verify Pro badge shows on dashboard
   - Verify user appears in admin panel Pro Members tab

## Important Notes

1. **Order Number AD0C97**: This was created by the old buggy code. The SQL migration will delete it.

2. **Uploaded Design Files**: These are stored in Stripe customer metadata and copied to `user_profiles.pro_current_design_file`. Make sure the file URL is accessible.

3. **Shipping Addresses**: Captured during checkout and stored in `pro_default_shipping_address`. Used for monthly order generation.

4. **Monthly Order Generation**: The scheduled job reads from `pro_order_generation_log` table. The SQL migration initializes this.

5. **Stripe Customer Portal**: Requires `pro_stripe_customer_id` to be set. This is now saved correctly.

## Support

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check Stripe Dashboard webhook logs for errors
2. Check Railway logs for backend errors
3. Run SQL query to verify user profile data:
```sql
SELECT 
    email,
    is_pro_member,
    pro_status,
    pro_plan,
    pro_stripe_customer_id,
    pro_stripe_subscription_id,
    pro_current_design_file
FROM user_profiles up
JOIN auth.users au ON au.id = up.user_id
WHERE au.email = 'jayfowler@outlook.com';
```

4. Check for Pro orders:
```sql
SELECT 
    order_number,
    order_status,
    order_tags,
    created_at
FROM orders_main
WHERE user_id = (SELECT id FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'jayfowler@outlook.com')
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```
