# 🎯 Pro Member System Implementation Summary

## ✅ **Complete Pro Member Workflow Implementation**

### **1. Pro Signup Process** ✅
- **Mandatory Design Upload**: Design file upload is now REQUIRED before proceeding with Pro membership
- **No Skip Option**: Removed "Skip Upload & Continue" - users must upload a design to proceed
- **Stripe Webhook Integration**: `handleSubscriptionCreated` creates initial Pro order with uploaded design file
- **Metadata Passing**: Design file URL is passed through Stripe customer metadata (`uploadedFileUrl`)
- **Shipping Address Capture**: Automatically captures shipping address from Stripe Checkout and stores as default
- **Initial Order Creation**: Creates SS-XXXX format order with 100 custom matte vinyl stickers (3") at $0.00
- **Welcome Email**: Sends comprehensive welcome email explaining the Pro benefits and next steps

### **2. Order Management** ✅
- **Dual Display**: Pro orders appear in BOTH "Custom Orders" and "Pro Orders" tabs in admin panel
- **Pro Branding**: Orders display Pro logo + "$0.00 (Pro Benefit)" instead of regular pricing
- **Order Tags**: Pro orders are tagged with `['pro-monthly-stickers', 'pro-member', 'monthly-benefit']`
- **SS-XXXX Order Numbers**: All Pro orders use the standard order numbering system (not PRO-timestamp)
- **Automated Generation**: Monthly orders are created automatically every 30 days via passive scheduler
- **Self-Contained Scheduling**: No third-party cron required - runs passively on API requests (max once per hour)
- **Order Specifications**: 100 quantity, Custom shape, Matte material, 3" size (exactly as specified)

### **3. Design Approval System** ✅
- **One-Time Approval**: Once a design is approved by admin, no re-approval needed for future prints
- **Status Tracking**: Tracks `pro_design_approved`, `pro_design_approved_at` in user profiles
- **Admin Controls**: Admin can approve designs via GraphQL mutation `approveProMemberDesign`
- **Email Notification**: Sends approval confirmation email when design is approved

### **4. Design Swap Feature** ✅
- **Swap Design Button**: Pro members can change their monthly design via intuitive UI
- **File Upload Integration**: Reuses existing Cloudinary upload system
- **Real-time Updates**: Design changes update user profile and reset approval status
- **Visual Feedback**: Shows current design, approval status, and lock status
- **Approval Reset**: New design requires re-approval (email sent when approved)

### **5. 5-Day Lock System** ✅
- **Production Window**: Designs are locked 5 days before printing to prevent production conflicts
- **Lock Status Tracking**: Tracks `pro_design_locked`, `pro_design_locked_at` in user profiles
- **Automated Locking**: Scheduler automatically locks designs 5 days before next order
- **Warning Emails**: Sends reminder 3 days before lock date
- **Lock Notification**: Sends email when design is locked for production
- **UI Indicators**: Shows lock status with visual indicators and prevents changes
- **Admin Control**: Admin can manually lock designs via `lockProMemberDesign` mutation

### **6. Shipping Address Management** ✅
- **Automatic Capture**: Shipping address captured from Stripe Checkout during signup
- **Default Storage**: Stored in `pro_default_shipping_address` field in user profile
- **User Dashboard UI**: Full shipping address management interface in Pro Membership dashboard
- **Edit Capability**: Pro members can update their default shipping address anytime
- **Auto-Apply**: Updated address automatically applies to unfulfilled Pro orders
- **GraphQL Mutation**: `updateProMemberShippingAddress` for address updates

### **7. Comprehensive Email System** ✅
- **Welcome Email**: Sent on first Pro order creation with full benefits explanation
- **Monthly Order Email**: Sent when each monthly order is generated (includes design status)
- **Design Approved Email**: Sent when admin approves a design
- **Lock Warning Email**: Sent 3 days before design locks for production
- **Design Locked Email**: Sent when design is locked (5 days before order)
- **Payment Failure Email**: Sent when subscription payment fails with recovery instructions
- **Cancellation Email**: Sent when subscription is canceled with feedback request
- **Smart Templating**: All emails branded with Pro colors and include action buttons

### **8. Automated Scheduling System** ✅
- **Self-Contained**: No external cron services required
- **Passive Checking**: Runs automatically on GraphQL requests (debounced to 1 hour)
- **Tracking Database**: `pro_order_generation_log` table tracks next order dates for each member
- **30-Day Cycle**: Orders generated 25 days after subscription start (5 days before renewal)
- **Manual Trigger**: Admin endpoint `/api/admin/run-pro-scheduler` for manual execution
- **Design Locking**: Automatically locks designs 5 days before order generation
- **Reminder System**: Sends 3-day warning emails before design lock

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Database Schema Updates**
```sql
-- New columns added to user_profiles table:
ALTER TABLE user_profiles ADD COLUMN pro_design_approved BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
ALTER TABLE user_profiles ADD COLUMN pro_current_design_file TEXT;
ALTER TABLE user_profiles ADD COLUMN pro_design_approved_at TIMESTAMPTZ;
ALTER TABLE user_profiles ADD COLUMN pro_design_locked BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;

ALTER TABLE user_profiles ADD COLUMN pro_shipping_address_updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ;
ALTER TABLE user_profiles ADD COLUMN pro_payment_failed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
ALTER TABLE user_profiles ADD COLUMN pro_last_payment_failure TIMESTAMPTZ;

-- New tracking table for order generation automation:
CREATE TABLE pro_order_generation_log (

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting Guide**

### **Order Not Generating Automatically**
**Symptoms:** Monthly orders not being created after 30 days

**Checks:**
1. Verify `pro_order_generation_log` table exists and has records
2. Check `next_order_date` for the member
3. Ensure scheduler is running (check API logs for "🔄 Running Pro order scheduler")
4. Verify member's `pro_status` is 'active'
5. Check for payment failures (`pro_payment_failed` flag)

**Solution:**
- Manually trigger: `POST /api/admin/run-pro-scheduler`
- Check tracking status: `SELECT * FROM pro_order_generation_log WHERE user_id = 'xxx'`
- Resume paused subscriptions in Stripe

### **Design Not Locking**
**Symptoms:** Design remains unlocked past lock date

**Checks:**
1. Verify scheduler is running
2. Check `next_order_date` - lock happens 5 days before
3. Ensure design is approved first

**Solution:**
- Manually lock: `lockProMemberDesign(userId)` mutation
- Check scheduler logs for errors
- Verify member's tracking record exists

### **Shipping Address Not Captured**
**Symptoms:** `pro_default_shipping_address` is null after signup

**Checks:**
1. Verify Stripe Checkout collected shipping address
2. Check `subscription_metadata.checkout_session_id` exists
3. Review webhook logs for `handleSubscriptionCreated`

**Solution:**
- Member can manually add via Pro dashboard
- Admin can trigger address update mutation
- Re-capture from Stripe session if < 30 days old

### **Emails Not Sending**
**Symptoms:** Pro members not receiving notifications

**Checks:**
1. Verify `RESEND_API_KEY` is set in Railway environment
2. Check email-notifications.js exports
3. Review API logs for email send errors
4. Confirm member email is valid in profile

**Solution:**
- Check Resend dashboard for delivery status
- Verify email templates are rendering correctly
- Ensure `sendEmail()` function is being called

### **Orders Using Wrong Format**
**Symptoms:** Orders have `PRO-{timestamp}` instead of `SS-XXXX`

**Checks:**
1. Verify `generateOrderNumber()` function exists in api/index.js
2. Check that function is being called in order creation
3. Review recent code changes to order generation logic

**Solution:**
- All Pro orders should now use SS-XXXX format
- If still occurring, check if old code is cached
- Restart Railway backend deployment

### **Pro Member Can't Update Address**
**Symptoms:** Address update fails or doesn't save

**Checks:**
1. Verify `updateProMemberShippingAddress` mutation exists
2. Check user authentication token
3. Ensure member's `is_pro_member` is true
4. Review browser console for GraphQL errors

**Solution:**
- Check mutation response for specific error
- Verify all required address fields are provided
- Ensure backend GraphQL schema includes mutation
