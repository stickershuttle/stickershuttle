# Webhook Debugging Session - Order Sync Issue Resolution

**Date**: June 17, 2025  
**Issue**: Customer orders creating draft orders in Supabase but not converting to paid orders when payments complete  
**Status**: IN PROGRESS - Webhooks updated, testing required

---

## üîç Problem Summary

**Initial Issue**: Orders were creating draft entries in Supabase but not converting to paid status when customers completed payments through the Vercel frontend.

**Expected Behavior**: 
1. Customer places order ‚Üí Draft order created
2. Customer completes payment ‚Üí Webhook fires ‚Üí Draft order converts to paid order
3. Paid order appears in customer dashboard

**Actual Behavior**: Only draft orders were appearing, no paid orders in dashboard.

---

## üß™ Investigation Process

### 1. Initial System Architecture Verification

**Frontend**: Next.js deployed on Vercel (`https://stickershuttle.vercel.app`)  
**Backend**: Apollo Server on Railway (`https://stickershuttle-production.up.railway.app`)  
**Database**: Supabase  
**Payment**: Shopify dev store (`sticker-shuttle-dev.myshopify.com`) with Bogus Gateway  

### 2. Database Analysis

**Scripts Created**:
- `test-order-sync.js` - Check order status in Supabase
- `check-production-orders.js` - Verify production database state
- `simulate-paid-order-webhook.js` - Test webhook logic manually

**Initial Findings**:
```
üìã Draft Orders: 3
üí∞ Paid Orders: 0
üéØ Dashboard Shows: 0 orders (paid only)
```

**Dashboard filtering was correct** - it only shows paid orders, which was the intended behavior.

### 3. Webhook Configuration Analysis

**Scripts Created**:
- `check-dev-store-webhooks.js` - Verify Shopify webhook setup
- `check-shopify-webhooks.js` - Check webhook endpoints

**Initial Webhook Configuration**:
```
‚úÖ orders/paid: https://stickershuttle-production.up.railway.app/webhooks/orders-paid
‚úÖ orders/create: https://stickershuttle-production.up.railway.app/webhooks/orders-create  
‚úÖ draft_orders/update: https://stickershuttle-production.up.railway.app/webhooks/draft-orders-update
```

Webhooks were properly configured in Shopify dev store.

### 4. Railway Server Investigation

**Critical Discovery**: Railway server was not responding to external requests!

**Test Results**:
```bash
# Health check failed
‚ùå Server health check failed: timeout of 5000ms exceeded
‚ùå Invoke-WebRequest timeout: The operation has timed out
```

**Root Cause Found**: Multiple Railway projects existed, but webhooks were pointing to the wrong one.

### 5. Railway Project Analysis

**Discovery**: User had 3 Railway projects:
- `stickershuttle-production` (DOWN - webhooks pointing here)
- `enchanting-upliftment` (ACTIVE - should be used)
- `gleaming-fascination` (unknown status)

**Scripts Created**:
- `test-railway-urls.js` - Test different Railway URL patterns
- `test-new-webhook-url.js` - Test updated webhook endpoints

**Working Railway URL Found**: `https://enchanting-upliftment-production.up.railway.app`

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Webhook Handlers

**File**: `api/webhook-handlers.js`

**Key Improvements**:
- Added `ensurePaidOrderInSupabase()` function to find matching draft orders by customer email and price
- Enhanced `orders/paid` webhook to convert draft orders to paid status
- Improved error handling and logging
- Added comprehensive order matching logic

**Code Enhancement**:
```javascript
// Enhanced logic to find matching draft orders and convert them to paid
async function ensurePaidOrderInSupabase(shopifyOrder) {
  // Find matching draft orders by email and price
  // Update them to paid status with real Shopify order ID
  // Prevent duplicate order creation
}
```

### 2. Webhook URL Correction

**Problem**: Webhooks pointing to inactive Railway project  
**Solution**: Updated Shopify webhooks to point to active Railway project

**Old URLs**:
```
https://stickershuttle-production.up.railway.app/webhooks/*
```

**New URLs**:
```
https://enchanting-upliftment-production.up.railway.app/webhooks/orders-paid
https://enchanting-upliftment-production.up.railway.app/webhooks/orders-create
https://enchanting-upliftment-production.up.railway.app/webhooks/draft-orders-update
https://enchanting-upliftment-production.up.railway.app/webhooks/orders-fulfilled
```

### 3. Comprehensive Testing Suite

**Created Diagnostic Scripts**:

1. **`test-order-sync.js`** - Check order status and identify issues
2. **`check-production-orders.js`** - Verify production database state  
3. **`check-dev-store-webhooks.js`** - Verify Shopify webhook configuration
4. **`check-recent-webhook-activity.js`** - Cross-reference Shopify orders with Supabase
5. **`simulate-paid-order-webhook.js`** - Test webhook processing logic
6. **`test-railway-urls.js`** - Find working Railway endpoints
7. **`test-new-webhook-url.js`** - Test updated webhook URLs
8. **`manual-webhook-test.js`** - Manual webhook testing

## üìä Test Results & Verification

### Before Fix
```
üì¶ Shopify Order #1036: $520.00 - PAID ‚úÖ
üìã Supabase: Only draft orders, no paid orders ‚ùå
üéØ Dashboard: Empty (correctly filtered) ‚ùå
```

### During Investigation
**Confirmed**: 
- Payment processing worked (customer received confirmation email)
- Order #1036 existed as PAID in Shopify
- Webhook endpoints were unreachable (Railway server down)
- Draft order creation was working correctly

### After Railway URL Fix
**Updated Shopify Webhooks**: ‚úÖ Completed  
**Railway Server**: ‚úÖ Responding (404 on /health but server reachable)  
**Webhook Endpoints**: ‚è≥ Testing required  

---

## üéØ Current Status

### ‚úÖ Completed
1. **Enhanced webhook handlers** to properly convert draft orders to paid orders
2. **Fixed Railway URL** in Shopify webhook configuration
3. **Verified webhook routing** logic handles order matching correctly
4. **Created comprehensive test suite** for future debugging
5. **Deployed updates** to Railway via GitHub Actions

### ‚è≥ Pending Verification
1. **Live order test** - Need to place test order on Vercel site
2. **Webhook firing confirmation** - Verify Shopify sends webhooks to new URL
3. **Order conversion test** - Confirm draft orders convert to paid status
4. **Dashboard display** - Verify paid orders appear in customer dashboard

## üìù Lessons Learned

1. **Multiple Railway Projects**: Always verify which project is active and receiving traffic
2. **Webhook URL Verification**: Test webhook endpoints independently of Shopify configuration
3. **Order Matching Logic**: Use multiple criteria (email + price) to match draft orders to paid orders
4. **Comprehensive Testing**: Create diagnostic scripts for complex webhook workflows
5. **Environment Consistency**: Ensure dev/staging/prod environments use correct service URLs

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Complete live order test** to verify webhook processing
2. **Monitor Railway logs** during order placement for webhook activity
3. **Verify dashboard functionality** shows paid orders correctly
4. **Document successful test** for future reference
5. **Consider webhook verification** for additional security
