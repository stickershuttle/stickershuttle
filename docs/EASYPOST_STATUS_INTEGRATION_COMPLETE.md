# EasyPost Status Integration - Complete Solution

## Issues Addressed ✅

### 1. **Tracking Info Not Showing Despite Payment**
- **Problem**: EasyPost charged for labels but tracking updates weren't received
- **Solution**: Added EasyPost webhook endpoint at `/webhooks/easypost`
- **Result**: Automatic tracking status updates from EasyPost

### 2. **Admin Status Not Updating to "Shipped"**  
- **Problem**: After purchasing labels, order status didn't change to "Shipped"
- **Solution**: Updated `buyEasyPostLabel` mutation to set `order_status: 'Shipped'` and `proof_status: 'shipped'`
- **Result**: Orders automatically show "Shipped" status after label purchase

### 3. **Missing Admin Filter Options**
- **Problem**: Admin only had 3 filter options (Building, Awaiting, Approved)
- **Solution**: Added full status progression filters
- **Result**: Now has 7 filter options: Building → Awaiting Approval → Approved → Label Created → Shipped → Out for Delivery → Delivered

## New Features Added 🚀

### **Enhanced Admin Order Filters**
```
Building           - Orders creating proofs
Awaiting Approval  - Proofs sent to customers  
Approved          - Customer approved proofs
Label Created     - Shipping labels purchased
Shipped           - Orders in transit
Out for Delivery  - Orders out for delivery
Delivered         - Orders delivered
```

### **Automatic Status Updates**
- **Label Purchase** → Status: "Shipped", proof_status: "shipped"
- **EasyPost Webhooks** → Auto-update based on carrier tracking
- **Status Mapping**:
  - `pre_transit`/`in_transit` → "Shipped" 
  - `out_for_delivery` → "Out for Delivery"
  - `delivered` → "Delivered"
  - `exception`/`failure` → "Shipping Issue"

### **Visual Status Colors**
- 🟡 **Yellow**: Building Proof
- 🟠 **Orange**: Awaiting Approval  
- 🟢 **Green**: Approved & Delivered
- 🔵 **Blue**: Label Created
- 🟣 **Purple**: Shipped
- 🟦 **Indigo**: Out for Delivery
- 🟤 **Amber**: Changes Requested
