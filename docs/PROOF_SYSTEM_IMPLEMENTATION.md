# Proof System Implementation

## Overview
A comprehensive proof management system has been implemented that allows admins to upload design proofs and customers to review and respond to them.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Admin Interface Improvements
- **Cart button removed** from admin pages (`/admin/*`) in header
- **Proof upload section** added above order status in order details view
- **Drag & drop file upload** with progress tracking and preview
- **Multiple file support** (up to 25 proofs per order)

### 2. File Upload System
- **Cloudinary integration** with dedicated "proofs" folder
- **File validation** (.ai, .svg, .eps, .png, .jpg, .psd, max 10MB)
- **Progress tracking** during upload
- **Preview system** shows uploaded files immediately
- **Auto-upload** when files are dropped/selected

### 3. Database Schema
- **New `proofs` column** added to `orders_main` table (JSONB array)
- **Indexed for performance** with GIN index
- **SQL migration script** provided in `docs/ADD_PROOFS_COLUMN.sql`

### 4. GraphQL API Extensions
- **New types**: `OrderProof`, `OrderProofInput`
- **New mutations**: 
  - `addOrderProof` - Admin uploads proof
  - `updateProofStatus` - Customer responds to proof
- **Extended queries** to include proofs in order data

### 5. Customer Proof Portal
- **New `/proofs` page** for customers to view their proofs
- **Authentication required** - redirects to login if not signed in
- **Order listing** showing only orders with proofs
- **Proof details view** with full-size image display

### 6. Customer Actions
- **Approve Proof** - Mark proof as approved
- **Request Changes** - Request modifications with notes
- **Upload New File** - Customer can upload revised files
- **Notes system** - Customers can add feedback and comments

## File Structure

### Frontend Components
```
src/components/ProofUpload.tsx - Admin proof upload component
src/pages/proofs.tsx - Customer proof portal
```

### Backend Changes
```
api/index.js - Extended GraphQL schema and resolvers
docs/ADD_PROOFS_COLUMN.sql - Database migration script
docs/PROOF_SYSTEM_IMPLEMENTATION.md - This documentation
```

### Updated Components
```
src/components/UniversalHeader.tsx - Cart button conditional display
src/pages/admin/orders.tsx - Integrated proof upload
src/utils/cloudinary.ts - Added folder support
```

## Usage Instructions

### For Admins
1. Go to `/admin/orders`
2. Click on any order to view details
3. Use the "Upload Proofs" section above order status
4. Drag & drop or click to select proof files
5. Files automatically upload to Cloudinary "proofs" folder
6. Proofs are saved to the order in Supabase

### For Customers
1. Visit `/proofs` (requires login)
2. View all orders that have proofs
3. Click on an order to see proof details
4. For pending proofs, customers can:
   - Approve the proof
   - Request changes with notes
   - Upload a new file for revisions

## Technical Details

### Proof Object Structure
```json
{
  "id": "proof_1234567890_abc123",
  "orderId": "order-uuid",
  "proofUrl": "https://res.cloudinary.com/dxcnvqk6b/image/upload/proofs/file.jpg",
  "proofPublicId": "proofs/file",
  "proofTitle": "Design Proof 1",
  "uploadedAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "uploadedBy": "admin",
  "status": "pending|approved|changes_requested",
  "customerNotes": "Customer feedback",
  "adminNotes": "Admin notes"
}
```

### Status Flow
1. **pending** - Initial status when proof is uploaded
2. **approved** - Customer approves the proof
3. **changes_requested** - Customer requests modifications

## Database Setup
Run the SQL script to add the proofs column:
```sql
-- See docs/ADD_PROOFS_COLUMN.sql for full script
ALTER TABLE orders_main 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS proofs JSONB DEFAULT '[]'::jsonb;
```

## Cloudinary Folders
- `proofs/` - Admin-uploaded proof files
- `customer-files/` - Customer-uploaded revision files

## Future Enhancements
- Email notifications when proofs are uploaded/responded to
- Proof versioning system
- Batch proof approval
- Proof comments/chat system
- Admin dashboard for proof status overview
- Mobile-optimized proof viewing

## Testing
1. Create a test order in the system
2. Go to admin orders and upload a proof
3. Log in as the customer and visit `/proofs`
4. Test approval, change requests, and file uploads

## Security Notes
- Customer authentication required for `/proofs` page
- File upload validation prevents malicious files
- GraphQL resolvers include error handling
- Supabase RLS can be added for additional security
