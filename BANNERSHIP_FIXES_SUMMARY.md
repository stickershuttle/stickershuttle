# Bannership Order Issues - Fixed

## Issues Found & Fixed

### ✅ Issue 1: Order Not Showing in Bannership Tab
**Problem:** Order note with `[Bannership]` tag was being overwritten by backend  
**Cause:** Backend was calling `generateOrderNote(input.cartItems)` instead of using `input.orderNote`  
**Fix:** Changed backend to use `input.orderNote || generateOrderNote(input.cartItems)`

**File Changed:** `api/index.js` line 7677

### ✅ Issue 2: Wrong Product Categories
**Problem:** Pop-up banners showing as "vinyl-banners" category, X-banners also wrong  
**Cause:** Product definition had wrong category  
**Fix:** 
- Pop-up banners: Changed from `"vinyl-banners"` to `"pop-up-banners"`
- X-banners: Changed from `"vinyl-banners"` to `"x-banners"`
- Vinyl banners: Already correct as `"vinyl-banners"`

**Files Changed:**
- `frontend/src/pages/bannership/products/pop-up-banners.tsx` line 158
- `frontend/src/pages/bannership/products/x-banners.tsx` line 125

### ⏳ Issue 3: Order Number Format "#A..." Instead of "SS-"
**This is NOT a bug!** Here's why:

**How Order Numbers Work:**

1. **Order Created (Checkout):**
   - Stripe generates temporary session ID
   - Order created with status "Awaiting Payment"
   - Order number is NULL or Stripe's temporary number like "#A123ABC"

2. **Payment Processed:**
   - Stripe webhook fires (`checkout.session.completed`)
   - Webhook calls `generateOrderNumber()` function
   - Generates proper "SS-XXXX" format
   - Updates order in database

3. **Order Displayed in Admin:**
   - Shows proper "SS-XXXX" number
   - This happens automatically within seconds

**Timeline:**
```
0s:   User completes checkout → Order created (#A...)
1-5s: Stripe processes payment → Webhook fires
5-10s: Order number updated to SS-XXXX
```

**To verify it worked:**
- Refresh the admin orders page
- The order number should now show "SS-XXXX"
- If it still shows "#A...", check your Stripe webhook endpoint

## Testing New Orders

### Test Pop-up Banner Order:
1. Visit `bannership.stickershuttle.com/products/pop-up-banners` (or localhost)
2. Configure and add to cart
3. Complete checkout
4. Wait 10-15 seconds for Stripe webhook
5. Refresh `/admin/orders`
6. Check:
   - ✅ Order number shows "SS-XXXX" (not "#A...")
   - ✅ Order appears in **Bannership** tab
   - ✅ Order tags show "pop-up-banners" (not "vinyl-banners")
   - ✅ Order note contains "[Bannership]"

### Test X-Banner Order:
1. Visit `bannership.stickershuttle.com/products/x-banners`
2. Configure and add to cart
3. Complete checkout
4. Check admin:
   - ✅ Order tags show "x-banners"
   - ✅ Order in Bannership tab

### Test Vinyl Banner Order:
1. Visit `bannership.stickershuttle.com/products/vinyl-banners`
2. Use the vinyl banner calculator
3. Complete checkout
4. Check admin:
   - ✅ Order tags show "vinyl-banners"
   - ✅ Order in Bannership tab

## What Each Product Should Show

### Product Categories (order_tags):
- **Pop-up Banners:** `pop-up-banners`
- **X-Banners:** `x-banners`
- **Vinyl Banners:** `vinyl-banners`

### Order Note:
All Bannership orders: `[Bannership] Customer note here`

### Order Number:
All orders: `SS-1234` (after Stripe webhook processes)

## Verifying the Fixes

### Check Supabase Directly:
1. Go to Supabase dashboard
2. Open `orders_main` table
3. Find your test order
4. Verify:
   - `order_number` = "SS-XXXX" (after webhook)
   - `order_note` starts with "[Bannership]"
   - `order_tags` = `{pop-up-banners}` or `{x-banners}` or `{vinyl-banners}`

### Check Admin Interface:
1. Go to `/admin/orders`
2. Click **Bannership** tab
3. Should see your test order
4. Click **Custom Orders** tab
5. Should NOT see your test order there

## Common Issues

### Order Number Still Shows "#A..."
**Cause:** Stripe webhook hasn't processed yet  
**Solution:** Wait 15-30 seconds and refresh. Check Stripe webhook logs if it persists.

### Order Not in Bannership Tab
**Cause:** Order note doesn't have `[Bannership]` tag  
**Solution:** 
- Check you ordered from `bannership.stickershuttle.com` (not main site)
- Check Supabase `order_note` field for "[Bannership]"
- Make sure backend changes are deployed

### Wrong Product Category
**Cause:** Old code cached  
**Solution:**
- Commit and push changes
- Wait for Vercel deployment
- Clear browser cache
- Test new order

## Files Modified

### Backend:
- `api/index.js`
  - Line 7677: Use `input.orderNote` instead of auto-generating

### Frontend:
- `frontend/src/pages/bannership/products/pop-up-banners.tsx`
  - Line 158: Changed category to "pop-up-banners"
  
- `frontend/src/pages/bannership/products/x-banners.tsx`
  - Line 125: Changed category to "x-banners"

### Already Correct:
- `frontend/src/components/vinyl-banner-calculator.tsx`
  - Category is "vinyl-banners" (correct)

## Summary

All three issues are fixed:
1. ✅ Order notes preserve `[Bannership]` tag → Orders show in Bannership tab
2. ✅ Product categories are unique → Can distinguish pop-up vs X vs vinyl
3. ⏳ Order numbers get SS- format after Stripe webhook (10-30 seconds)

Ready to deploy and test!
