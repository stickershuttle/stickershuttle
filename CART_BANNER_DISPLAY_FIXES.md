# Cart Page Banner Display Fixes

## ‚úÖ All Cart Issues Fixed

The cart page now properly handles all three banner types with correct pricing and labeling.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Pricing Calculation** 
**Problem:** Pop-up and X-banners were using sticker pricing instead of their calculated banner prices  
**Fix:** Updated pricing logic to recognize all three banner categories

```typescript
// Now checks for all banner types
if (item.product.category === 'vinyl-banners' || 
    item.product.category === 'pop-up-banners' || 
    item.product.category === 'x-banners') {
  // Use original calculator pricing
}
```

### 2. **"Per Sticker" vs "Per Banner" Display**
**Problem:** Cart showed "per sticker" even for banner products  
**Fix:** Dynamic text based on cart contents

```typescript
// Counts all banner types
const bannerCount = productTypes.filter(type => 
  type === 'vinyl-banners' || 
  type === 'pop-up-banners' || 
  type === 'x-banners'
).length;

// If cart has only banners ‚Üí shows "per banner"
// If cart has stickers ‚Üí shows "per sticker"
// If mixed ‚Üí shows "per sticker"
```

### 3. **Item Type Labels**
**Problem:** Pop-up and X-banners labeled as "stickers"  
**Fix:** All banner types now correctly labeled as "banner/banners"

```typescript
case 'vinyl-banners':
case 'pop-up-banners':
case 'x-banners':
  return quantity === 1 ? 'banner' : 'banners';
```

### 4. **Quantity Increments**
**Problem:** Banners incrementing by 50 like stickers  
**Fix:** All banner types increment by 1

```typescript
if (item.product.category === 'vinyl-banners' ||
    item.product.category === 'pop-up-banners' ||
    item.product.category === 'x-banners') {
  return 1; // Increment by 1
}
```

### 5. **Field Labels**
**Problem:** Showing "Material" for banner products  
**Fix:** Shows "Finishing" for all banner types

```typescript
return (productCategory === "vinyl-banners" || 
        productCategory === "pop-up-banners" || 
        productCategory === "x-banners") ? "Finishing" : "Material";
```
