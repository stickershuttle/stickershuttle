# ðŸš€ Sticker Shuttle Launch Plan Summary

## âœ… COMPLETED TODAY (Critical Security Fixes)

### ðŸ”’ Security Vulnerabilities FIXED
1. **CORS Configuration** âœ… 
   - **BEFORE**: Allowed ALL origins (`origin: true`) - MAJOR security risk
   - **AFTER**: Restricted to production domains only + localhost for dev
   - **Impact**: Prevents unauthorized cross-origin attacks

2. **Rate Limiting** âœ…
   - **BEFORE**: No rate limiting - vulnerable to abuse/DDoS
   - **AFTER**: Implemented comprehensive rate limiting:
     - API calls: 100 requests/15 minutes per IP
     - File uploads: 10 uploads/hour per IP
     - Webhooks: 1000 requests/hour per IP
   - **Impact**: Protects against abuse and ensures service availability

3. **Security Headers** âœ…
   - **BEFORE**: Missing critical security headers
   - **AFTER**: Full Helmet.js implementation with:
     - Content Security Policy (CSP)
     - HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)
     - XSS Protection
     - Frame Options
   - **Impact**: Protects against XSS, clickjacking, and other web attacks

### ðŸ§ª API Testing Verification âœ…
- **Health endpoint responding**: âœ… Status 200
- **Security headers present**: âœ… CSP and HSTS confirmed
- **Service status confirmed**: âœ… API running correctly
- **EasyPost integration**: âœ… Configured and ready

## ðŸ”§ TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS MADE

### API Security Configuration
```javascript
// CORS - Now properly restricted
const allowedOrigins = [
  'https://stickershuttle.com',
  'https://www.stickershuttle.com',
  // localhost only in development
];

// Rate Limiting - Comprehensive protection
const generalLimiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100, // requests per window per IP
});

// Security Headers - Full Helmet.js
app.use(helmet({
  contentSecurityPolicy: { /* Stripe-compatible CSP */ },
  hsts: { maxAge: 31536000, includeSubDomains: true }
}));
```

### Verification Results
