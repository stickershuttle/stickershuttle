# Bannership Admin Tab Implementation

## âœ… Implementation Complete

A new "Bannership" tab has been added to the `/admin/orders` page to filter and display all orders containing banner products.

## What Was Added

### 1. **Order Detection Logic**
Added `isBannershipOrder()` helper function that identifies orders containing:
- Products with "banner" in the name
- Products with "banner" in the category
- Pop-up banners
- X-banners
- Vinyl banners

### 2. **Tab State Management**
Updated `orderTab` state to include three options:
- `'all'` - Custom sticker orders (excludes Market Space and Bannership)
- `'marketspace'` - Market Space orders
- `'bannership'` - **NEW** Bannership orders

### 3. **Filter Logic**
Updated order filtering to:
- Show only Bannership orders when "Bannership" tab is selected
- Exclude Bannership orders from "Custom Orders" tab (so they don't mix)
- Keep Market Space filtering separate

### 4. **UI Components**
Added Bannership tab button in two locations:

**Mobile/Tablet View:**
- Green-themed button (`bg-green-500/20 text-green-300`)
- Appears below stats, above filters

**Desktop View:**
- Same green-themed styling
- Appears in compact filter bar at top

## How It Works

### Detection Logic
```typescript
const isBannershipOrder = (order: Order) => {
  if (!order.items || !Array.isArray(order.items)) return false;
  return order.items.some(item => {
    const productName = item.productName || '';
    const category = item.productCategory || '';
    return productName.toLowerCase().includes('banner') || 
           category.toLowerCase().includes('banner') ||
           productName.toLowerCase().includes('pop up') ||
           productName.toLowerCase().includes('x-banner') ||
           productName.toLowerCase().includes('vinyl banner');
  });
};
```

### Filter Flow
```
User clicks "Bannership" tab
  â†“
orderTab state changes to 'bannership'
  â†“
Orders are filtered to show only those with banner products
  â†“
Display shows: "X orders" (only Bannership orders)
```

## Tab Behavior

**Custom Orders Tab (Blue):**
- Shows orders that are NOT Market Space and NOT Bannership
- Traditional sticker orders only

**Market Space Tab (Purple):**
- Shows marketplace/creator orders
- Unchanged from before

**Bannership Tab (Green):** âœ¨ NEW
- Shows all orders containing banner products
- Includes: Pop-up Banners, Vinyl Banners, X-Banners

## Visual Design

The Bannership tab uses green theming to match the brand:
- **Active state:** Green background with green border
- **Inactive state:** Gray text that turns white on hover
- **Color scheme:** `bg-green-500/20 text-green-300 border-green-500/40`

## Testing Instructions

1. Navigate to `/admin/orders`
2. You should see three tabs: "Custom Orders", "Market Space", "Bannership"
3. Click "Bannership" tab
4. Should show only orders containing banner products
5. Click "Custom Orders" tab
6. Should NOT show banner orders anymore (they're filtered out)

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

### Option 1: Add Order Source Tracking
If you want to know which orders specifically came from `bannership.stickershuttle.com`:

1. **Add a field to track order source:**
   - Update order creation to store `order_source` or `referrer_domain`
   - Track: `stickershuttle.com`, `bannership.stickershuttle.com`, `marketplace`

2. **More granular filtering:**
   - Show orders by product type (current implementation)
   - OR show orders by source domain (future enhancement)
   - OR both!

### Option 2: Subdomain in Order Note
Add to cart context when on bannership subdomain:
```typescript
// In CartContext or checkout
if (window.location.hostname.startsWith('bannership.')) {
  orderNote += ' [Ordered from bannership.stickershuttle.com]'
}
```

## Files Modified

- `frontend/src/pages/admin/orders.tsx`
  - Added `isBannershipOrder()` helper function
  - Updated `orderTab` type to include `'bannership'`
  - Updated filter logic to handle Bannership tab
  - Added Bannership tab UI (mobile and desktop)

## Notes

- Orders with banner products are automatically detected by product name/category
- No database changes required
- Works with existing order data
- Custom Orders tab now excludes banner orders to keep things organized
- All existing functionality preserved
