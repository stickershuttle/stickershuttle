## 🔧 **TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS MADE**

### **API Security Configuration**
```javascript
// Before: MAJOR security vulnerabilities
app.use(cors({ origin: true })); // ❌ Allowed ALL origins

// After: Production-ready security
const allowedOrigins = ['https://stickershuttle.com', 'https://www.stickershuttle.com'];
app.use(cors({ origin: allowedOrigins })); // ✅ Restricted origins
app.use(helmet()); // ✅ Security headers
app.use(rateLimit()); // ✅ Abuse protection
```

### **Error Monitoring**
```javascript
// Backend: Comprehensive error capture
Sentry.init({
  environment: process.env.NODE_ENV,
  tracesSampleRate: 0.1, // Performance monitoring
  beforeSend: productionFiltering
});

// Frontend: User-friendly error boundaries
<Sentry.ErrorBoundary fallback={CustomErrorUI}>
  <App />
</Sentry.ErrorBoundary>
```
